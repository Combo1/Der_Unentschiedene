<h2>Data Visualization: Graphically supported hypotheses</h2>
<p>
When trying to detect causations between variables, the representation of the varables via different plots, plays an essential role in assessment of the hypothesis. By taking a structured
approach one can much more easily show their analysis.
    <b>Descriptive vs associative plots</b>
While descriptive plots show how data is distributed in associative plots one can see relationsships between the variables, which can lead to hypothesis testing.
Descriptive plots:
<ul>
    <li>histogram</li>
    <li>boxplot</li>
    <li>violin plot</li>
    <li>clustered heatmap</li>
    <li>PCA projections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced Algorithms: Minimum Cuts</h2>
Given an undirected Graph G = (V,E) we want to find a disjoint partition V_1, V_2 of V, such that the number of edges running between the two partitions is as small as possible -> minimum
cut.

We can solve this problem by considering a randomized algorithm, which randomly contracts an edge of the graph until only two vertices are left. This can be computed with a running time of
O(n^2) and with a probability of working (n over 2)/(2^(n-1) -1). By iterating this random edge contraction algorithm, we can get our minimum cut with a probability of n^(-2d).

Another way to find the minimum cut is the Fast-Cut algorithm. For this method we apply contraction twice onto our graph so that each time t vertices remain. We get as output two
graphs H_1 and H_2 onto which we recursively call the Fast-Cut algorithm again. Afterwards we check, which result H_1 or H_2 is better and output the smaller cut. This algorithm has a
running time of O(n^2 log n) with a probability of finding the minimum cut of Omega(1/log n).

Another problem poses the minimum weighted cuts, where we seek to find a partition whose weights among edges between the partition is as small as possible.
